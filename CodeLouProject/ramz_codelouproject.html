  <h3 class="borderdiv">A Website Created For My Wonderful Pup! Ramz is a 6 year old German Shepherd Husky Mix. 
    Ramz has been under my care since 2015. Together we have explored Louisville, Kentucky. Some of his favorite 
    activities are Hiking, Camping, and relaxing by the river. Ramz is also very social! He has many human and furry 
    friends too and he gets really excited just by hraring their names! Ramz is very responsive to commands and our 
    conversations in general. Through our conversations Ramz has shared with me that he would like his next hiking venture 
    to be Otter Creek Park.  </h3>

    <h2>Waterfront Wednesday</h2>
    <p>On this day Ramz and I had been on a run earlier that day. By the time we made it to the Waterfront he wanted less to do with walking around, and more to do with just enjoying my company and relaxing.   </p>

    <h2>I'm on a boat!</h2>
    <p>On this beautiful Summer day Ramz and I hopped on board onto our friend Zach's boat. Ramz was finally able to rock his brand new water vest. Ramz was happy to be on the edge like this because it reminded him of Rose in The Titanic.   </p>
