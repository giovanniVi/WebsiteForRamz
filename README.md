code lou project
This Project was challenging to say the least but I feel extremely confident in my skills as a front end student. I learned so much about myself in this process and I cannot wait to learn more and grow as a Web Developer. The reason I chose this specific subject for my project is simply that I wanted to practice my skills in a fun playful way to keep myself as minimally frusterated as possible and I'll take any opportunity to show off my best friend Ramz. The CSS and JS requirements at first intimidated me but I slowly found ones that would work for this project and for my skill set. The CSS requirments I attempted to meet were the Collapsable Nav menu and I succesfully imported bootstrap. For my Javascript it was a bit easier to find one that would work for my page. I did a form with a submit button that collects the input and returns a statement using the variables the user put in.
